## Django Basics

### Running the server

The Django server is started via the runserver command.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Initialising the Admin Panel with a user

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

### PythonAnywhere

Updating static files (e.g. CSS) must be done manually via the PythonAnywhere bash console using the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

Once you have a user setup, you can access Django's awesome Admin panel at /admin/. For added security this url can be changed to something more obscure via ```/mysite/urls.py```
