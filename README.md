## Django Basics

### Running the server

The Django server is started via the runserver command.

```Shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Initialising the Admin Panel with a user

```Shell
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

### PythonAnywhere

Updating static files (e.g. CSS) must be done manually via the PythonAnywhere bash console using the following command:

```Shell
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

Once you have a user setup, you can access Django's awesome Admin panel at ```/admin/```. For added security this url can be changed to something more obscure via ```/mysite/urls.py```

### Adding models to the database

When creating a new Django project, you must create a models.py file. This file contains the database models. Any additions to the models.py file will only be reflected in the database if you run the following commands:

```Shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations blog
```

```Shell
python3 manage.py migrate blog
```
